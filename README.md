This project involves real-time image classification using a pretrained model built with Keras and TensorFlow. It leverages a webcam to capture images, processes them, and classifies them into categories based on a set of labels.# face_recognition
Its an image model trained data that identifies the face of the model and gives the confidence score of an trained model


Environment Setup:


TensorFlow and Keras: Used for loading the pretrained model (keras_Model.h5) and making predictions.
OpenCV (cv2): Used for capturing images from the webcam and performing image resizing.
NumPy: Utilized for handling image data as arrays and preprocessing the images.

Model Loading:

The pretrained model is loaded from keras_Model.h5 using the load_model function from Keras. This model is set to compile=False to avoid recompiling it during loading, which speeds up the process.
Label Loading:

Class names for the model predictions are read from labels.txt. Each line corresponds to a class label, and these are stripped of newline characters and stored in a list called class_names.
Webcam Integration:

A webcam is accessed using OpenCV's VideoCapture. The camera object is initialized with the parameter 0, which typically refers to the default webcam. The project can also switch to another camera by changing this parameter to 1 or other indices.
Real-Time Image Processing:

The webcam captures frames continuously in a loop.
Each captured frame is resized to 224x224 pixels to match the input size required by the model.
The resized image is displayed in a window using OpenCV.
Image Preprocessing:

The image is converted to a NumPy array and reshaped to match the model's expected input shape (1, 224, 224, 3).
Normalization is performed by scaling pixel values to the range [-1, 1] using the formula (image / 127.5) - 1.
Prediction:

The processed image is passed to the model for prediction using model.predict(image).
The argmax function is used to find the index of the class with the highest predicted probability.
The corresponding class name and confidence score are extracted and displayed.
Display Results:

The predicted class name and confidence score are printed to the console in real-time.
Exit Mechanism:

The loop listens for keyboard input and breaks if the Esc key (ASCII code 27) is pressed, gracefully releasing the webcam and closing the OpenCV window.
Potential Use Cases:

Real-Time Object Recognition: This setup can be adapted for real-time object recognition applications.
Security and Surveillance: It can be used to classify and detect objects or people in security camera feeds.

Educational Tools: Demonstrates basic concepts of machine learning, image processing, and computer vision.
Improvements and Extensions:

Model Optimization: The model could be optimized for faster inference or converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on edge devices.

User Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) can be developed to make it more user-friendly.
Advanced Processing: Add features like multi-object detection, bounding boxes, or confidence thresholds.
